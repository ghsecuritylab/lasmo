# LASMO

## Changelog

#### Wednesday, 7 Nov 2018

- **ChibiOS** imported in project.
  - the choice is mainly motivated by the simplicity of ChibiOS and the great number of boards of its HAL.
  - using ChibiOS leads us to use a **GPLv3** license.
- Adding the license file to the repo.
- The protocol chosen for the animations of the laser is the **ILDA** protocol
  - it is mostly because it's the most popular format and thus it's well-documented and we can find help on the Internet if we need to.
  - official specification of the format was added in the `General documentations` folder

#### Wednesday, 14 Nov 2018

- Replaced **ChibiOS** with **FreeRTOS**
- Changing the license because of the change of OS
